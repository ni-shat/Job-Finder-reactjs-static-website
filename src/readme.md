### JOB FINDER



JobFinder project involves creating a website that helps job seekers find job circulars and apply for jobs, with several features to enhance the user experience. Job circulars will be displayed in a clear, easy-to-read format, with all relevant details such as job title, company name, location, and job description included. Users will be able to apply for jobs directly from the website. This project included few features that are mentioned below:

* The home page will feature a list of job categories, such as Account & Finance, Creative Design, Marketing & Sales, and Engineering Job. Users can click on a category to view available job postings in that category.

* In the below of that section, there is another section features a list of four job postings, with basic information such as the job title, company name, job type, salary and location etc. Each job posting will have a "View Details" button that users can click to view more information about the job, including the job description, job responsibilty, requirements, experiences, as well contact information for the hiring company.  If the user decides to apply for the job, they can click an "Apply Now" button, which will store the application information in local storage. If the user attempts to apply for the same job twice, they will receive an alert informing them that they have already applied for the job.

* To see more job postings, users can click a "See all jobs" button, which will take them to a page displaying all available job postings. This page will allow users to filter job postings by various criteria, such as type of job (#onsite or #remote).

* The website also features a statistics page that displays an area bar chart of the average of eight assignments. This page is designed to provide analytics on job assignments.

* In addition, the website includes a blog page that answers some common questions about ReactJS basics, helping users improve their programming skills.

* Finally, the website includes a 404 page, which displays an error message when users try to access a page that does not exist or has been removed.
